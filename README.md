##### Example output:

`It was all a dream, I used to read PYTHON magazine

DIEGO and ERIN up in the limousine

Hangin' BURRITOS on my wall

Every Saturday APPLE MUSIC, JUSTIN BIEBER, Marley Marl

I let my IPHONE rock 'til my IPHONE popped

TYPING DELICIOUS on AIRHEADS, sippin' on PENGUIN Stock

Way back, when I had the TURQOISE and PINK lumberjack

With the hat to match

Remember Rappin' ADAM CANNON? Duh-ha, duh-ha

You never thought that INFORMATION SCIENCE would take it this far

Now I'm in the limelight cause I WORK OUT tight

Time to get paid, SLEEP at the World Trade

Born sinner, the opposite of a winner

Remember when I used to eat KEYBOARDS for dinner

Peace to MARTHA KIM, JOE TOHDJOJO, Kid Capri

ALLAN TAN, Lovebug Starski

I'm DANCING up like you thought I would

Call the crib, same INSTAGRAM, same hood

It's all good

And if you don't know, now you know, CANADIAN`
